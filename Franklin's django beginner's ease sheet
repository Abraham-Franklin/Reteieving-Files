create a folder(website)
install a virtual environment("pip install virtualenv")
assign a name to the virtual environment for example-venv ("virtualenv venv")
activate the virtual environment - for windows ("scripts\activate\venv)
				  - for linux ("source venv/bin/activate")
install django("pip install django")
to see all django command("django-admin")
create an app for example-sitepage ("django-admin startproject sitepage")
test to see if you've been sucessful all this while - for windows ("python manage.py runserver")
						      - for linux ("python3 manage.py runserver")
put in your address in your browser ("http://127.0.0.1:8000/")

open your folder(website) directory in your text editor preferrably visual studio code
create an app for  example-members  - for windows ("python manage.py startapp members")
		    		     - for linux ("python3 manage.py startapp members")
go to your newly created app(members), locate your views.py file
add ("from django.http import HttpResponse")
still in the views.py file create a function and pass in an argument of request ("
def myFunction(request):
    return HttpResponse("My First Django Page")    
")
go to your newly created app(members), create a new file in the app directory called ("urls.py")
in the newly created file(urls.py), type in ("
from django.urls import path
from . import views
")
still in urls.py, create a dictionary and assign it to a variable name called urlpatterns and put in the path to your views function ("
urlpatterns = [
    path('members/', views.myFunction, name = 'myFunction')
]
")
now go to your app's folder(sitepackage), locate the urls.py file there and add include to our imports there ("from django.urls import path, include")
add a new path to the urlpatterns dict. ("path('', include('members.urls')),") 


refresh your browser and you should see ("My First Django Page") displayed on your screen


create a folder in your app(members) called ("templates")
create an html file and call it anything -for example(myFirst.html)
make any design of your choice
go to your project(sitepage), go your "settings.py" file, locate "INSTALLED_APPS"
add the name of your app in quotes ("
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    'members',
]
")

go to your views.py in your app 
you can choose to create a new function or use the initially created function
remove the ("return HttpResponse("My First Django Page")")
and replace with return render(HttpResponse, 'myfirst.html') -----("
def myFunction(request):
    return render(HttpResponse, 'myfirst.html')
")

OR

go to your views.py in your app 
you can choose to create a new function or use the initially created function
import loader from django.template ("from django.template import loader")
migrate - for windows ("python manage.py migrate")
	- for linux ("python3 manage.py migrate")
remove the ("return HttpResponse("My First Django Page")")
and replace with ("
def myFunction(request):
    template = loader.get_template('myfirst.html')
    return HttpResponse(template.render())
")


then refresh your browser and you should see your html designs displayed















making specific migrations, you cal the app
